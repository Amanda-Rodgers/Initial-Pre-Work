//<!--I learned when JavaScript variables are initially declared they have a value of undefined and if used in a math operation the result will be NaN-->
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a"

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
